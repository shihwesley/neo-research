Turns any topic into agent expertise: structured question tree → source discovery → zero-context fetch (content never enters LLM context) → .mv2 indexing → REPL-based distillation → compact expertise artifact. Also runs Python in isolated Docker containers for code execution, DSPy sub-agents, and data analysis.",
